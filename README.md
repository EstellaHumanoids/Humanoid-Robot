# Estella Humanoid Robot ðŸ¤–
**An open-source, human-inspired humanoid robot - a mirror of us.**

---

## About
Estella is an **open-source humanoid robot** designed for research, education, and innovation. Its modular design focuses on **human-inspired anatomy** and expressive interaction. Current modules include:

- **Face**
- **Spine**  
- **Shoulders**

The project started in 2017 under **Prof. Behnam Rahnama** at Medis Startup Studio. It was developed through the joint efforts of Prof. Rahnama, **Negin (Fatemeh) Heiran**, and supporting colleagues. Today, Estella continues as an **independent open-source project**, guided by Negin and a global community of contributors.

Estella is more than a robot, itâ€™s a platform for learning, experimentation, and collaboration.
