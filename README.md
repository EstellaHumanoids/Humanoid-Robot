# Estella â€” Humanoid Robot ðŸ¤–
**An open-source, human-inspired humanoid robot â€” a mirror of us.**

---

## About
Estella is an **open-source humanoid robot** designed for research, education, and innovation. Its modular design focuses on **human-inspired anatomy** and expressive interaction. Current modules include:

- **Spine**  
- **Face**  
- **Shoulders**

The project started in 2017 under **Prof. Behnam Rahnama** at Medis Startup Studio. It was developed through the joint efforts of Prof. Rahnama, **Negin (Fatemeh) Heiran**, and supporting colleagues. Today, Estella continues as an **independent open-source project**, guided by Negin and a global community of contributors.

Estella is more than a robotâ€”itâ€™s a platform for learning, experimentation, and collaboration.

## Features
- **Modular and extensible design** â€” each component can be replaced or upgraded independently.  
- **Human-inspired mechanics** â€” realistic spine, expressive face, and articulated shoulders.  
- **Open-source 3D models** â€” CAD files, STEP, STL, and renders for easy access.  
- **Community-driven development** â€” everyone can contribute, learn, and iterate.
