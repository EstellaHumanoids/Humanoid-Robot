# ðŸ¤– Estella Humanoid â€“ Spine Module  

This folder contains the **3D design files (.STEP format)** for the Spine module of Estella.  
The Spine is built from a **series of three 3-RSS parallel mechanisms**, designed to mimic the natural **S-shape curvature** of the human spine and provide lifelike flexibility.  

ðŸ‘‰ When combined with the **Neck module**, it replicates the entire human spinal columnâ€™s posture and dynamics.  

## ðŸ“‚ Files  
- `_Spine Assembly Neutral Position.STEP` â€” main CAD design of the spine mechanism.  

## ðŸ”„ Other Formats  
To save repository space, only **STEP files** are uploaded here.  
If you need the files in other formats (e.g., STL, OBJ, Parasolid), please contact me directly:
