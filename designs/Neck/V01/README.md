# ðŸ¦´ Estella Humanoid â€“ Neck Module  

This folder contains the **3D design files (.STEP format)** for the Neck module of Estella.  
The Neck is designed as a **parallel mechanism** to replicate natural head movements (pitch, yaw, and roll).  

ðŸ‘‰ When combined with the **Spine module**, it completes the natural **S-shape curvature** of the human spine, ensuring anatomically accurate motion.  

## ðŸ“‚ Files  
- `STEP/_Neck Assembly.step` â€” main CAD design of the neck mechanism.  

## ðŸ”„ Other Formats  
To save repository space, only **STEP files** are uploaded here.  
If you need the files in other formats (e.g., STL, OBJ, Parasolid), or willing to contribute please contact me directly:
